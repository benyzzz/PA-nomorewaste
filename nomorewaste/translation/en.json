The list may evolve rapidly thanks to significant expansion. The core idea of the association is to collect daily commercial surplus or products nearing their expiration date from individuals: upon request, trucks leave the association's headquarters, collect the products, and bring them to a storage facility. Deliveries are then made to distribute wherever needed. Additionally, NO MORE WASTE has developed a range of services to help everyone avoid waste, share resources, and save money. These services are accessible to the association's members for a small annual fee.",
